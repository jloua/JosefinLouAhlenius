# Hi there! 

I am a student at the Front End Developer program at Medieinstitutet, MalmÃ¶. 

Most of my repositories right now need to be private because they include solutions to school assignments that future classes might get. 
However I am in the process of building my own projects and will soon be working in public repos. 

My approach combines creativity and artistry with structured thinking. 
More information to come ðŸŒ±
